<p>Many users complain that Google Chrome becomes slow after some time. This usually happens because of heavy extensions, background processes, and poor browser settings. Fortunately, you can fix this in just a few minutes.</p>

<h2>Remove Unnecessary Extensions</h2>
<p>Too many extensions consume memory and slow Chrome. Open chrome://extensions and remove tools you don’t use frequently.</p>

<h2>Enable Hardware Acceleration</h2>
<p>Go to Settings → System → Enable “Use hardware acceleration when available”. This allows Chrome to use your device’s graphics processor for faster performance.</p>

<h2>Clear Cache Regularly</h2>
<p>Cached files improve speed temporarily but can slow the browser over time. Clear browsing data every few weeks for better performance.</p>

<h2>Use Chrome Task Manager</h2>
<p>Press Shift + Esc to open Chrome Task Manager and identify tabs consuming too much memory.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Optimizing Chrome regularly ensures faster browsing, smoother video playback, and better productivity.</p>
