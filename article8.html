<p>AI is transforming learning experiences by offering personalized content, instant feedback, and adaptive curricula. Tools like AI tutors and virtual classrooms allow students to learn at their own pace, improving engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Teachers benefit from AI by automating grading, tracking student progress, and identifying areas needing attention. This allows educators to focus more on teaching rather than administrative tasks.</p>
<p>Educational institutions are integrating AI to enhance online learning, provide analytics for student performance, and create interactive content. AI also assists in skill development and career guidance for students.</p>
<p>This guide explores AI applications in education, from primary schools to universities, and how they are shaping the future of learning in 2026.</p>
